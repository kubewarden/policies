# Contributing to Kubewarden Policies

Thank you for your interest in contributing! This document outlines the
technical workflow for developing, testing, and releasing policies within this
repository.

Kubewarden is language-agnostic. This repository contains policies written in
Rust, Go and Rego.

# Directory Structure

This repository is a monorepo. While each policy is functionally independent,
they share common tooling and dependencies.

```text

```

# Rust Workspace

To optimize build times and ensure consistency, all Rust policies are members
of a single Rust Workspace. The `policies/Cargo.toml` defines the workspace
members. Common dependencies are shared across policies to reduce maintenance
overhead. When adding a new Rust policy, ensure it is added to the members list
in the root Cargo.toml.

# How to Build Policies

We use `make` to provide a consistent interface across different programming
languages.

Navigate to the policy directory:

```console
cd policies/policy-name
```

Build the Wasm binary:

```console
    make policy.wasm
```

# How to Test Policies

All policies in this repository should provide unit test and integration tests.
To run all the tests run the following command:

```console
make test e2e-tests
```

## Language-Scoped Makefile Targets

The root `Makefile` provides targets that operate across all policies
regardless of language (`test`, `lint`, `e2e-tests`). For faster iteration,
language-scoped variants are also available.

| Target           | Scope                                                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `test-rust`      | Rust policies (detected by `Cargo.toml`) + shared crates under `policies/crates/` |
| `test-go`        | Go policies (detected by `go.mod`)                                                |
| `lint-rust`      | Rust policies + shared crates under `policies/crates/`                            |
| `lint-go`        | Go policies                                                                       |
| `e2e-tests-rust` | Rust policies                                                                     |
| `e2e-tests-go`   | Go policies                                                                       |

The language detection is file-based: a policy directory is considered Rust if
it contains a `Cargo.toml`, and Go if it contains a `go.mod`. These sets are
mutually exclusive. The shared crates under `policies/crates/` are all Rust and
are included in the `*-rust` targets for `test` and `lint` (consistent with the
full-repo targets), but not for `e2e-tests` since crates have no end-to-end
tests.

# How to Release a Policy

The release process is fully automated via CI/CD to ensure consistency and
provenance. This repository has CI that automate the task of bumping policy
version in all places required. This is done by the
`.github/workflows/trigger-policy-release.yml`. When this CI is run users can
define the next version to be released like this:

```console
gh workflow run trigger-policy-release.yaml \
    -f "policy-working-dir=allowed-proc-mount-types-psp-policy" \
    -f "policy-version=1.0.6" \
    -R kubewarden/policies
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `policy-working-dir` must be the name of the directory under the
> `policies` directory

In this scenario, the CI will open a PR bumping the version in all required
files. Once this PR is merged another CI will detect the release, create the
tag and continue the release process.

However, if you already bump the version, you can omit the `policy-version`
field:

```
gh workflow run trigger-policy-release.yaml \
    -f "policy-working-dir=allowed-proc-mount-types-psp-policy" \
    -R kubewarden/policies
```

Therefore, the CI will skip the PR to update the files and go strait to tagging
the release the policy artifacts.

> [!NOTE]
> The `trigger-policy-release.yaml` CI can also be trigged in the Github UI.

The release CI flow is something like this:

```mermaid
flowchart TD

A[Trigger trigger-policy-release.yaml ] --> B{CI inputs has version}

B -->|Yes| C[Open PR updating version in files]
B -->|No| D[Trigger the release-tag.yaml to create the tag]
D --> E[Tag created]
E --> F[Trigger release.yaml]
C --> G[PR merged]
G --> D
F --> H[Policy released]
I[User push a new tag] --> E
```

# Tag Pattern

The CI creates tags using the following logic based on the subdirectory under
the `policies` directory modified:

```
<policy-subdirectory-name>/v<semantic-version>`
```

Example: If you update the `pod-privileged-policy` policy to version `0.1.5`,
the CI will generate the tag: `pod-privileged-policy/v0.1.5`
