/// This module contains the rust types of SBOMscanner CRDs.
///
/// The official SBOMscanner CRDs include some mandatory fields, which are reflected in the Rust types here.
/// However, this policy makes use of field masks to prune all the unnecessary data from the response.
/// That causes deserialization to fail since some non-Optional fields are missing in the response.
///
/// Removing these fields from the Rust types was avoided to preserve future flexibility.
///
/// Initially, a feature flag was used to control the inclusion of these fields, enabled only during tests.
/// This approach conflicted with the Makefile setup, as all Rust policy tests were run without the feature.
///
/// As a solution, the code now checks the architecture:
/// - The WASM policy omits the pruned fields in its types.
/// - Tests run with all fields present.
